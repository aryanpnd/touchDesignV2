# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Test app icon & splash locally

The project already includes an app icon and splash image under `assets/images` and the configuration in `app.json` is set to show a white background with the app logo centered.

To test the splash and icon locally:

1. Start the dev server:

```powershell
npx expo start
```

2. For a full splash experience you should build a development client (recommended):

```powershell
npx expo prebuild && npx eas build --profile development --platform all
```

Or run on an emulator/simulator where the native splash will be visible when the app launches.

If you want to change the splash or icon, replace the files in `assets/images` (`splash-icon.png`, `icon.png`, `adaptive-icon.png`) and restart the dev server.
